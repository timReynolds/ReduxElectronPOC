# ReduxElectronPOC
Proof of concept for using a react/flux app inside electron

## Running 
  - npm install electron-prebuilt -g 
  - cd ReduxElectronPOC
  - npm install
  - npm run start
  - electron . 
  
## Notes
  - Webpack server really isn't needed could build assets and run without, just been lazy to get this running as a POC
